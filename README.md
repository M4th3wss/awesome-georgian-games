Glass Cannon is a difficult but chill physics-based roguelike where you plan each of your shots carefully to eliminate all your enemies in as few shots as possible. The game plays like a slower, almost turn-based shoot-em-up where you make builds and combinations that help you score big and ravage your enemies.
